                <h2>Tom Cruise</h2>
                <p>Tom is the only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, Mary Lee (Pfeiffer), a special education teacher,
                    and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky,
                    and he has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Young Tom spent his boyhood always on the move, and by
                    the time he was 14 he had attended 15 different schools in the U.S. and Canada. He finally settled in
                    Glen Ridge, New Jersey, with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, he developed an interest
                    in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest, dropped out of school, and at age 18 headed for
                    New York and a possible acting career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made
                    his film debut with a small part in Endless Love (1981) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box
                    office appeal to both male and female audiences.</p>
